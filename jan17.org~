* Technologial Advancements in Health Care

** From robtos to 3D printers, more and more technology is available to those with medical needs

** Aging Japan turns to robots for health care

** In America and other aging societies, it has become common fo the elderly to be cared for by their graying children or order workers. That's largely because the younger labor force is shrinking and few want to do such low-paying back-aching work.

** Japan helps the enfeebled--with robots

** At Minami Tsukuba nursing home near Tokyo, caregiver Asami Konishi wears a robotic device on her hips taht cuts the stress on her backwhen she bends and lifts someone.

** It really helps when I have to pick up a heavier male patient," said the 34-year -old. The lumbar device and other cyborg suits made by Cyberdyne Inc. can help the wearer build strength  and restore mobility, like standing up and walking. Cyberdyne's gear works by reading bioelectric signals form the brain to the muscles, thus mimicking and supporting the movement intended. "It fuses th ehuman and robots and information systems." said Yoshiyuki Sankai, an engineer who founded Cyberdyne in 2004.

Japan's lead in advanced robotics for health care is driven by its demographics conundrum. More than most, the nations's population is shrinking and aging rapidly.
